The moving mirror is the first and main visual aspect of the piece. It is placed at the extremity of the area, hanging on the wall. It comprises several little mirrors that combine to make one large mirror. The mirror will tilt in various directions, following the viewer's movements, and tiny mirrors will reflect the viewer's appearance as it appears from each direction. The participants can see themselves reflected from various angles from their perspectives in addition to the mirror moving with them. It gives the participants a familiar and foreign visual effect by reflecting human faces at densely packed and various angles.

<p>
To create a forest of mirrors, additional mirrors will be present throughout the surrounding space of the installation. They will be placed in various configurations around the area. The visual representation of the mirror includes multiple shapes to reflect the participants' entire bodies. Mirrors of different shapes reflect various limbs. For instance, the mirror may be warped to depict an exaggerated and fat body shape, expressing negative labels or the lack of social acceptance and support for such individuals. Participants can see their bodies in the mirror's reflection, as if the mirrored pictures of various shapes blend with them, changing the participants' body type, attire, attitude, etc.
